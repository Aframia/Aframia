# Sandra Aframea Ofosu 🇬🇭
 **`Student | Developer | Designer`**


 ## 👋About Me
 I'm an undergraduate student at KNUST, pursuing a BSc in Food Science and Technology. I vividly recall countless hours during my childhood, Browsing the internet to play games like Baby Hazel, which sparked my initial fascination with anything tech-related. Finally, realized the foundation of all stunning websites began with 'Hello World.'

This discovery led me to the path of Web Development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and to learning Python. 

I aspire to become a full-stack developer and to advance my knowledge in working with AI as this technology continues to grow. 

My passion extends beyond mere execution; I'm driven to create work that has a positive and lasting impact. I identify as Sandra.
